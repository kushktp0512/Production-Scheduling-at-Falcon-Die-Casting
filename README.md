Falcon Die Casting (FDC), an Ohio-based automobile manufacturer, has patented a high volume die casting method using traditional machines. They received a bulk order for five key die cast items used in most automobiles. The client estimates demand for the next 12 weeks, with demand beyond week 2 tentative and likely to change based on prior sales.
FDC produces five machines, each capable of producing a subset of parts. The design capacity can meet long-term customer demand for five parts, but its effective capacity can only satisfy demand if a significant percentage of items are not quality demanded. FDC's yield factors predict the proportion of parts meeting customer quality specifications, and Table-2 provides production rates for five parts in five different machines.
Production operates from Monday to Friday with three eight-hour shifts, resulting in 120 hours per week. Weekends are used for maintenance and experimentation, with a maximum overtime of 48 hours per week. Machine setup times range from 8 to 24 hours, and production of parts may need to be scheduled multiple times.
The production manager, Tom Kelly, aims to schedule production optimally, ensuring employees are paid and half for overtime. He aims to meet the demand for 5 parts with the least overtime. Tom is also concerned about the impact of the company's policy not carrying finished goods or inventory from week to week and wants to perform routine maintenance on weekends without disrupting machine setups.
